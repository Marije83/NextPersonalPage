export const myBio = " I am a software developer who might not have much experience in the tech industry yet, but can offer many transferable skills from my previous jobs as academic & lecturer in linguistics, and senior project manager in equality, diversity and inclusion. I started teaching myself C# in September 2022, completing several learning paths on Microsoft Learn (Take your first steps with C#, Add logic to your applications with C#, and Work with data in C#). In addition, I recently completed a bootcamp in software engineering with Skills City to acquire foundational programming skills in Python, as well as full-stack developer skills using HTML5, CSS (tailwind), JavaScript, React.js, Next.js and SQL (PostgreSQL). As a former lecturer in linguistics and senior project manager in equality, diversity and inclusion, some of the transferable skills I acquired in these roles include: excellent communication and presentation skills in a wide range of written and verbal formats, project management, qualitative and quantitative research methods and data analysis (inc. semi-automated textual analysis and digitisation of acrhival materials), and working with colleagues from diverse professional and cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, I comprehend new material quickly, independently and with minimal supervision."
